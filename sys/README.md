# Some system setup stuff

* `dns.txt` - Some alternative DNS servers to use.
* `shellx64-works.efi` - I have a quirky mobo and this is the only thing that lets it boot in UEFI mode.
* `ssh.md` - SSH setup & tips.
* `background.png` - Grub background for Manjaro & Arch. Goes in `/usr/share/grub/background.png`.
