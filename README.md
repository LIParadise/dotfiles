# Tanath's Dotfiles (and related)

My `.zshrc`, `.vimrc` & other config files & system alterations.

`.zprompt.zsh` is a tweaked version of [Phil's zsh prompt](http://aperiodic.net/phil/prompt/) by [Bender](https://gist.github.com/bender-the-greatest/802e33cc20d0685c33715c3b8d035af5) (thanks!).

`.zpac.zsh` goes with `.zshrc` on pacman-based Linux distros.

`.zubuntu.zsh` goes with `.zshrc` on Debian-based Linux distros. It only has ubuntu in the name for easier tab-completion.
