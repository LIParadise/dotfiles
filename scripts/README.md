* `gvim.sh` - I set a keyboard shortcut to this script so I can select text and send it to a new buffer in gvim.
* `pyserver.sh` - If you want to quickly share some files with a temp web server, python has it built in. Configure port in script, and unprivileged user. Needs `sudo` to run as user.
* `webserv-nc.sh` - Fake web server to send a file over netcat to a browser. Configure port in script.
